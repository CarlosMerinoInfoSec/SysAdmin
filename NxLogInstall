.SYNOPSIS
    This script will check to see if NxLog is installed, if not an attempt to copy Nxlog file from a 
    network share to a local directory, and installation of nxlog will be done.  Nxlog also requires a conf file so 
    we will be replacing the one in the installation directory with the correct one and starting the service.
.DESCRIPTION
    Test locally and ensure the script runs as intended before automating deployments.
    Checks to see if Nxlog is installed if not then checks to see if the Nxlog MSI file is on the local 
    drive, if it is, it will install.  If it is not found locally it will try and connect to the network share 
    to copy and place on the local drive and then will run the installation.  If it can't connect to the remote
    share it will throw an exception and cancel the script.
.NOTES
    File Name       NxLogCheck&Install.ps1
    Author          :Carlos Merino
    Prerequisite    :If user is not connected to network and does not have msi file locally, script will throw exception.
