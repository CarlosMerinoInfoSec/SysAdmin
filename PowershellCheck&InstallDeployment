.SYNOPSIS
    This script will check to see if [software] is installed if not an attempt to copy [software] MSI file from a 
    network share to a local directory, and installation of [software] will be done.
.DESCRIPTION
    Test locally and ensure the script runs as intended before automating deployments.
    Checks to see if [software] is installed if not then checks to see if the [software] MSI file is on the local 
    drive, if it is, it will install.  If it is not found locally it will try and connect to the network share 
    to copy and place on the local drive and then will run the installation.  If it can't connect to the remote
    share it will throw an exception and cancel the script.
